        I am proud of all that I achieved, even if it does not apply to technology. I am always looking to learn, I seek out knowledge on a daily basis even if updating the information I had previously acquired. This also applies to 'Useless knowledge' which as I recently learned is not actually as useless as it's currently perceived.

          I took on this course as I was originally planning on looking at Data Analyst roles, which requires coding. Part way through the course, I had rediscovered my love of working with HTML, it began to come back to me after nearly 30 years (self taught). Though I could not work the way I used to (inline), I was encouraged to work with CSS, which was alien to me. Honestly I enjoy CSS, it does not break my projects as HTML alone does. Yeah, HTML can break itself! I learned this first hand when I had taught myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am glad that I took this course. It made me realise that I can have fun in a professional environment. And the tutor provided me with many tools to pursue Web Design/Development.

          Much like the Understanding Coding course, much of this was self taught. Further to this, it was more about improving and updating my skills I had gained, again nearly 30 years ago. Even building systems.
          <br>
          But this course allowed me to understand that there were some flaws in my methods especially in regards to Power Supply Units (PSU) and how much is actually needed per system.
          <br>
          <br>
          The course also allowed me to expand my knowledge and work in Cloud-based environments using Microsoft Azure and working within Virtual Machines to create mock business accounts and apply administrative rules & roles. And looked at making Networks and their Topographies including adding sub-domains.

        Guess what, some of this was self taught too. I took this course to better aid my identification skills and I now have much greater confidence in identifying specific animal groups. Some insect groups look similar to one another, but they have small features which distinguish them.
        <br>
        Beetles and Shieldbugs have similar charactaristics, particularly that of having a hard carapace. Because of that, people who are unfamiliar with the difference would typically call Shieldbugs beetles.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am an amateur naturalist and am passionate about wildlife. It was Sir David Attenborough who inspired me to become one. Starting with birds.
        <br>
        I do occasionally send data to various wildlife groups, such as British Dragonfly Society, Hoverfly Recording Scheme and British Trust for Ornithology which I am credited for my data along with other volunteers in their publication BTO Bird Atlas 2007-11.
