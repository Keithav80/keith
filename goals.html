      <h1>My Goals</h1>
      <p>
        My main goal at this point is to secure a role within IT, ideally Web
        Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know this won't be easy and straight forward, I've just picked up HTML
        again after playing around with it 26 years ago. And I've also learned
        very recently about CSS, which I've never used before, until my recent
        course with Code Nation.<br />
        I have been provided the tools to help me acheive my initial goal of
        becoming a Front-end Web Developer, and beyond if I so desire, and I
        will get there. But as mentioned on the home page, my skills will be
        translated onto this very site. You will be able to see the progress I
        make right here as I continue to build it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I probably need to add other goals, prior to acheiveing employment in my
        chosen field... There's a lot of learning to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you may have worked out, this is where I'll show my progress to
        acheiving my goal(s).

      <p>Next steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get back into HTML.</li>
        <li>Familiarise myself further with CSS.</li>
        <li>Learn JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
