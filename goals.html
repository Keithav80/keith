      <h1>My Goals</h1>
      <p>
        I had been made redundant in September 2022 and have struggled to look for work. But before I lost my job I had already started to think about a new career path. Unfortunately my timing was a little off!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Once I had lost my job I immediately started to look for work in IT. I thought it would be simple as I had achieved NVQs in Information Technology (IT) and Business Administration, but clearly I was wrong.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Things have changed a little since I had gained those achievements. And also CV was the wrong type, which had clearly held me back.
      </p>
        So I had to update my skills, first to update the IT skills and change my CV into the appropriate type.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My main goal at this point is to secure a role within IT, ideally Web Development. But I am willing to take on other roles such as IT Technician and 1st/2nd Line Support roles.
      </p>
      <br>
