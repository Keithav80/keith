      <p>
        I have many hobbies & interests and am always seeking to learn new
        things... I consider life boring if I'm not learning something.

        <li>Photography.</li>
        Much of what I photograph is wildlife.
        <li>Naturalist.</li>
        To date I have identified 752 animal species in the UK through my own
        recording. My data has been used for various animal recording schemes to
        aid in monitoring species populations. I have been credited in the
        British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Bird Atlas 2007-2011 for my data
        collection.
        <li>Walking.</li>
        My walking is often paired with my photography and my Naturalist skills.
        Sometimes even if I want to just chill and slow down, I can't help
        myself and randomly record the species I come across... What can I say,
        I love animals, even those that bite me and am allergic to (looking at
        you Mosquitos).
        <li>Astronomy.</li>
        I just hope in my lifetime Beetelguese goes supernova.

        <li>Writing Poetry.</li>
        I find that writing poetry is therapeutic, it allows me to vent off when
        I become overwhelmed.
        <li>Reading.</li>
        I typically read Autobiographies and materials to help me identify
        animals of various kinds.
        <li>Writing in Futhorc and Futhark (2 runic styles).</li>
        I just decide randomly to look into learning runic writing, it initially
        started with Futhark which is the most commonly known runic form. But I
        moved onto Futhorc, a.k.a Anglo-Saxon or Old English. If I write things
        by hand, I will often write in Futhorc.

          <li>Further developing my skills in Web Development.</li>
        Though this sites main purpose is to be an extension of my CV, it is
        also being used to further develop my skills it HTML and CSS.
        <li>Build and maintain PCs.</li>
        This is somewhat second nature to me now. Although I have been doing
        this since I was around 16 years old, I never had formal training and
        learned to build systems by taking them apart first. But as of 2024 I
        now have a City & Guilds Certification which officially recognises that
        I have the capacity to build and maintain systems.
        <li>Play video games.</li>
        I play various kinds of games, but one seems to have hogged much of my
        attention, Warframe. I love how the game is being developed with more of
        a story rather than just being a "Looter shooter". The story is probably
        the biggest reason why I keep playing that more than others.
        <li>Storm chasing (sort of)</li>
        Using various apps and web services to monitor local storms.
        <li>Listening to music.</li>
        I listen to many genres of music, even classical. My favourite genre is
        Metal, yet my favourite band is not.

        <li>Cooking & Baking.</li>
        I was taught from a young age, primary school, to cook. I remember
        making Chapatis and yoghurt mint sauce from an Indian woman, I remember
        her tasting all our results and considered mine the best one. Also, in
        High School a Home Economics teacher came up to me as I was preparing to
        make my decission on my choices, she said that Home Ec and the Design
        Tech departments were both fighting to have me with them. As much as I
        would have loved to be Home Ec, I had to consider that if I were to go
        with them I (rather my dad) would've had to pay for the ingredients for
        the food. Unfortunately we were a struggling family financially. The
        Design Tech Dept provided the materials. But I eventually got back into
        cooking & baking after being lazy for too long admittedly. Had I known
        then what I know now, I would've chosen Home Ec, it would've actually
        saved the family money.
        <li>Grow herbs and vegetables.</li>
        This started off as a weird experiment to see if I could grow potatoes
        indoors! It worked kind of, the plant grew, but it didn't produce the
        potatoes. That's because I had used a little too much fertiliser that
        allowed strong growth above and not below where it was planned. Now I
        grow Celery, Spring Onions, Ginger, Parsley occasionally Onions,
        Shallots and Peppers.
