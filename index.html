      <p>
        This site will feature my current projects, educational goals and also
        my interests.<br />
        Actually this site is essentially my first project and will be where
        you'll see my journey into Web Development (hopefully).

        Next task: The wall of text has been changed and has been made into sections. Still needs work though.
