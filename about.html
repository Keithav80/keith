      <p>
        I am an aspiring Front-end Web Developer who is currently awaiting my
        results for my Level 2 NCFE Certificate in Understanding Coding. I
        undertook this course to further develop my current IT skills and
        transition them into a new career path. I am currently developing this
        very Web page using the skills that I have acquired to showcase my
        skills and abilities, essentially building an extension to my CV. I am
        always looking to develop my skills and knowledge in numerous areas
        which makes me open-minded and adaptable.
